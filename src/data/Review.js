    review:"Both my best friend and I use the Mud buster to keep our pets paws clean after walks. It’s results you can clearly see when you pour the water out. All that dirt in the water would’ve been tracked around the house instead of down the drain. Definitely worth it.",

    review:"Scrubs dog paws well. After cleaning dog's foot I see the dirt and debris at bottom of cup. I have a Cane Corso puppy and it's comfortable enough for her to let me do it with no real problem. The first time she was a little confused but after that, everything's been easy. I give her a treat after we're done to reward her patience.",

    review:"Our neighbors told us about this tool, and we tried it. We hike in the hillsides outside of Boise, Idaho and in the spring our pup Scout’s feet get muddy. It was easy to fill with water, rinse her paws one by one while she is standing on the tailgate of our truck, and afterward, it is a quick rinse of the inside rubber lining and the container, and back in the truck for our next trip. So easy to put her paw in and then lift it up and down without the liner, getting stuck on her nails or dew claw. We are very happy with the product.",

    review:"This works very well on our large and medium sized dogs. Does a great job removing the mud. All that's left to do is gently squeeze the water off their paws and dry them with a towel.Highly recommend.",

    review:"Our dog has allergies to something environmental - grass, trees, bugs?? He would lick, and lick, and lick his paws to the point of them being hairless and sore. We started washing his paws with this product after each trip outside, adding a small amount of AVC and a dash of baking soda! Now his paws look awesome and he is definitely more comfortable.",

    review:"I bought this in November '22. It has been a game changer. My Jake is an ACD mix and loves water. Jake can free range on our property as we are very remote and the nearest neighbor is over 1.5 miles away. We have two dry ponds near our house that fill when we have rain. The Mud Buster makes clean up after a romp outside manageable.",

    review:"Love the size, the ease of use, and how efficient it is. The only thing I wish it had was a sealable top. When I take my pup out and she gets dirty feet, I want to be able to wash the dirt off before getting in the car. Other than this, it's a great product!",
